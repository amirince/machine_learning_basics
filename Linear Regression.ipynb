The data does not form a perfect straight line, this noise in the data makes it very challenging for it to converge at a particular equation since there will potentially always be some value for the MSE. Also, I ran the model for a great number of epochs, (approximately 100k) and found that the w<sub>0</sub> value approximates to 1.777.. and the w<sub>1</sub> value approximates to 1.862... the trend was that both w<sub>0</sub> and w<sub>1</sub> were increasing. I also plotted the graphs for both of these models (2x + 1) and (1.862x + 1.778) and found that the two lines were converging but after a certain point start to diverge. (See graph below)\n",
